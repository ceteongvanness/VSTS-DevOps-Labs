## Deploy ASP.NET application to Azure App Service using VSTS

This lab shows how to deploy an <a href="https://www.asp.net/">ASP.NET</a> application to Azure App Service with Visual Studio Team Services.

## Overview

ASP.NET is an open source web framework for building modern web apps and services. ASP.NET creates websites based on HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript that are simple, fast, and can scale to millions of users.

## Pre-requisites

1. **Microsoft Azure Account:** You will need a valid and an active azure account for this lab.

2. You need a **Visual Studio Team Services Account** and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate">Personal Access Token</a>


## Setting up the VSTS Project

1. Use <a href="https://vstsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net/?name=PartsUnlimited" target="_blank">VSTS Demo Data Generator</a> to provision the project on your VSTS account.

2. Once the project is provisioned, click the URL to navigate to the project.

## Exercise 1: Endpoint Creation

Since the connections are not established during project provisioning, we will manually create the endpoints.

In VSTS, navigate to **Services** by clicking the gear icon <img src="images/gear.png"> and click **+ New Service Endpoint**. Select **Azure Resource Manager**. Specify **Connection name**, select your **Subscription** from the dropdown and click **OK**. We use this endpoint to connect **VSTS** with **Azure**.

   <img src="images/endpoint_creation.png">

   You will be prompted to authorize this connection with Azure credentials.

   **Note**: Disable pop-up blocker in your browser if you see a blank screen after clicking OK, and retry the step.

## Exercise 2: Configure Release

Now that connections are established, we will manually map the endpoints to release definition.

> **Note** : Its important to follow the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/VSTS-DevOps-Labs/tree/endpointworkaround/endpointworkaround">Service Endpoint Workaround</a> document to have a successful deployment on Azure.

1. Go to **Releases** under **Build & Release** tab, edit the release definition **PartsUnlimitedE2E**.

   <img src="images/release.png">

2. Select **Tasks** and click **Dev**.

   <img src="images/release_2.png">

3. Under **Azure Deployment** task, update **Azure subscription** with the endpoint components from the dropdown and select the desired **location**.

   <img src="images/task1.png">

4. Under **Azure App Service Deploy** task, update **Azure subscription** with the endpoint components from the dropdown. Under the **Slot** section enter the slot name as **Dev**.

   <img src="images/task2.png">

5. Similarly update **Azure subscription** with the endpoint components for **QA** and **Production** environments. Go to **Tasks** and select **QA**.

   <img src="images/qa.png">

6. Under **Azure App Service Deploy** task, update **Azure subscription** with the endpoint components from the dropdown. Under the **Slot** section enter the slot name as **Staging**.

   <img src="images/qa_task.png">

7. Go to **Tasks** and select **Production**.

   <img src="images/prod_task.png">

8. Under **Azure App Service Deploy** task, update **Azure subscription** with the endpoint components from the dropdown and click **Save** to save the release definition.

   <img src="images/prod_task2.png">

## Exercise 3: Update Code

We will update the code to trigger CI-CD.

1. Go to the **Code** hub.

   <img src="images/code.png">

2. We have an **ASP.NET** app code provisioned by the demo generator system. We will deploy this to Azure app service.

3. We have a Continious Integration (CI) build setup to run upon a code commit. Let's make a simple change to the code to trigger the CI build.

4. Open the file **Index.cshtml** by navigating to the below path-
   
   > **PartsUnlimited-aspnet45/src/PartsUnlimitedWebsite/Views/Home/Index.cshtml**

   <img src="images/edit_code_1.png">

5. Edit the code. For this example, let's change **line 28** to increase discount from **50%** to **70%** 

   <img src="images/edit_code_2.png">

6. Select **Commit** to save and commit the changes. 

7. The code commit will trigger the CI build. Go to the **Build and Release** tab to see the CI build running in progress.

   <img src="images/build_overview.png">

   While the build is in progress, let's explore the tasks used in the build definition.

   <table width="100%">
   <thead>
      <tr>
         <th width="50%"><b>Tasks</b></th>
         <th><b>Usage</b></th>
      </tr>
   </thead>
   <tr>
      <td><img src="images/nuget.png"> <b>Nuget Installer</b></td>
      <td>We will use the nuget installer to restore all the package dependencies like <b>ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web Pages</b> etc. required to build this project.  </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td><img src="images/visual-studio-build.png"> <b>Visual Studio Build</b></td>
      <td>We will use the VisualStudio Build task to invoke MS build to compile and package the output in a zip file. Note that this project is compiled using Visual Studio 2017</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td><img src="images/vstest.png"> <b>Visual Studio Test</b></td>
      <td>As part of the build process, we will run all the unit tests using the VisualStudio Test task to ensure the code quality. This project contains 16 unit tests.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td><img src="images/copy-files.png"> <b>Copy Files</b></td>
      <td>We will copy the zipped file and the ARM template to a staging directory.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td><img src="images/publish-build-artifacts.png"> <b>Publish Build Artifacts</b></td>
      <td>And finally, we will publish the files in the staging directory which were copied in the previous step. </td>
   </tr>
   </table>
   <br/>

   
8. Click on the build number to open the build live console.

8. Once the build is complete, click on the build number to see the build summary including **Test Results, Code Coverage** etc.

## Exercise 4: Continuous Delivery

 We are using **Infrastructure as a Code** in the release pipeline. We have a release configured to deploy the application which is associated to the build and triggered when the build is successful.

1. Go to **Releases** tab under **Build and Release** hub.

2. Select the **PartsUnlimitedE2E** definition, you will see the release in-progress.

   <img src="images/release_in_progress.png">

3. While the release is in-progress, let's explore the tasks used. Click **edit** to see the release pipeline. We have three environments **Dev**, **QA** and **Production**.

   <img src="images/edit_release.png">

   >Go to the **Dev** environment, you will see 2 tasks are used. Let us explore the tasks.

   <img src="images/tasks.png">
   
   >- **Azure Resource Group Deployment**: The project used in this lab contains frontend (Azure App Service) and backend (Azure SQL DB) services. We will provision these services as <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/overview/what-is-paas/">PAAS on Azure</a> using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-create-first-template">ARM</a> templates. This task will create the above services in a resource group **ASPDOTNET**.

   >- **Azure App Service Deploy**: The task is used to deploy a Web project to the Azure App Service created above.

4. Click on **View releases**.

   <img src="images/view_releases.png">

5. Double click on the release to see the release summary.

   <img src="images/release_summary1.png">

   <img src="images/release_summary.png">

6. Login to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and search a **Resource Group** with the name **ASPDOTNET**.

   <img src="images/azure_resources.png">

7. Navigate to one of the WebApp from the resource group and you will see the application deployed successfully with the changes.
