# Deploy PHP application to Azure App Service using VSTS

## Overview


**PHP** is a server-side scripting language, and a powerful tool for making dynamic and interactive Web pages.

This lab shows how to deploy **PHP** application to **Azure App** service using **Visual Studio Team Services**.


## Pre-requisites

 1. **Microsoft Azure Account:**  You need a valid and active azure account for this lab.
 
 2.  You need a **Visual Studio Team Services Account** and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate">Personal Access Token</a>

 ## Setting Up the VSTS Project

1. Use <a href="https://vstsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net/?name=PHP&templateid=77365" target="_blank">VSTS Demo Data Generator</a> to provision a PHP project on your VSTS account.

2. Once the project is provisioned, click the URL to navigate to the project.

## Exercise 1: Endpoint Creation
Since the connections are not established during project provisioning, we will manually create the endpoints.

In VSTS, navigate to **Services** by clicking the gear icon <img src="images/gear.png"> , and click  **+ New Service Endpoint**. Select **Azure Resource Manager**. Specify connection name, select your subscription from the dropdown and click OK. We use this endpoint to connect VSTS with Azure.

You will be prompted to authorize this connection with Azure credentials.

**Note**: Disable pop-up blocker in your browser if you see a blank screen after clicking OK, and retry the step.

## Exercise 2: Configure Release Definition 

We will use ARM template as **Infrastructure as a Code**  in the release definition to provisions a Web App and a Web App Service Plan under the specified resource group.

  >**Note** : You will encounter an error - **TFS.WebApi.Exception: Page not found** for Azure tasks in the steps **3** & **4** of this exercise. This is due to a recent change in the VSTS Release Management API. While we are working on updating VSTS Demo Generator to resolve this issue, you can fix this by typing a random text in the **Azure Subscription** field and click the **Refresh** icon next to it. Once the field is refreshed, you can select the endpoint from the drop down.
 
1. Go to **Releases** under **Build and Release** tab, Select release definition **PHP** and click **Edit**

2. Go to **Tasks** and select **Dev** environment.

3. Under **Azure Resource Group Deployment** task, update **Azure subscription** and **Location**.

4. Under **Azure App Service Deploy** task, update **Azure subscription** and click **Save**.

      <td>deploys a PHP application to the created App service</td>
   </tr>

  </table>

## Exercise 3: Deploying the application

**PHP** is an interpreted language, so we don't have to compile the code. Instead we will create an archive file which will be deployed to the Azure App Service. 

Let's make a code change to trigger a CI-CD pipeline to build and deploy the application. 

1. Go to **Code** tab and navigate to the below path to edit the file.

   >php/config.php

1. Go to line number **11**, modify **PHP** to **DevOps for PHP using VSTS** and commit the code.

1. Go to **Builds** tab under **Build and Release** tab to see the associated CI build in progress.

   Let's explore the build definition. The tasks used in the build definition are listed as shown. 

  | Tasks | Usage |
  | --- | --- |
  | Archive files | We will archive all the files in the folder to a zip file |
  | Copy Files | Copy the ARM template and the Zip file to the artifact folder  |
  | Publish Build Artifacts |  Publish the build artifacts so that it is available to the Release pipeline  |
 
1. Once the build is complete, it triggers the CD pipeline. You can notice the linked release is in progress by navigating to **Releases** under **Build and Release**. The release will provision the Azure Web app and deploy the zip file generated by the associated build.

1. Alternatively, you can also login to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to the **Resource Group** that contains the Web App that was provisioned in the CD pipeline

1. Select the **App Service** and from the **Overview** tab,  click **Browse** to see the application deployed.
